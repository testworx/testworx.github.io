<p>Welcome to my new blog. It is very much a work in progress but I hope to use this as a way of sharing the more technically focussed testing lessons I learn. Hopefully it will be of use to someone else.</p>

<p>Expect to see articles on performance testing and test automation, in particular framework design and building maintainable test packs as this is something I have a strong interest in.</p>

<p>I intend to supplement the blog (or maybe it's the other way around!) with libraries on Github. These are libraries I have written in my own time to solve real problems identified during my day job.</p>

<p>All my useful code is published under the TestWorx GitHub organisation.  I decided to create this to separate anything useful that I wanted to share, from repositories I have forked or code that isn't considered functional that you might find under my personal account.</p>
